# Spin Damage - Expeditions Hack Nov 2016

The idea of this project was to create a hurricane simulator.
Given that ice caps are melting a sea levels are rising, we're starting to see storms forming a lot more often. This results in cases of extreme weather in the coast areas.

Using data from previous hurricanes, we set out to create a hurricane simulator. This simulator would tell us how devastating it's effect would be depending on its travel path and category level.

### How it works

* The user can use a line drawing tool, to put points in the map and connect them to form a line. This line is the hurricane path.
* From here, just press a the compute button to get estimates for real state and death toll for all 5 categories of hurricanes

### Tech used
* HTML/CSS, Javascript, Carto
